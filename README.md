# 2 Player Tank Game 

> ### By: Aidan Meharg 20112579

This application will be a simple competitive game with the goal of 
taking down your opponent.

Both players will operate their respective tanks with their own 
keyboard commands:
- Player 1 using **"w, a, s, d"** keys for movement and **"c"** to shoot
- Player 2 using **"i, j, k, l"** keys for movement and **"n"** to shoot
- Players may save their current game at any time by pressing **"6"**

Each player will begin with 3 lives which can be lost in 2 ways:
- Driving your vehicle into the boundaries (edge of screen)
- Getting hit by missiles launched by the opponent

Once a player has lost all 3 lives, their opponent is proclaimed victorious!

I decided upon this project idea because I have had so much fun in the 
past playing simple 2-player games (ex. Fireboy and Watergirl, Tanks 2 etc.)
