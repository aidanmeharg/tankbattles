# 2 Player Tank Game 

> ### By: Aidan Meharg 20112579

This application will be a simple competitive game with the goal of 
taking down your opponent.

Both players will operate their respective tanks with their own 
keyboard commands:
- Player 1 using the arrow keys for movement and **"/"** key to shoot
- Player 2 using **"w,a,s,d"** keys for movement and the spacebar to shoot

Each player will begin with 3 lives which can be lost in 2 ways:
- Driving your vehicle into the boundaries (edge of screen)
- Getting hit by missiles launched by the opponent

Once a player has lost all 3 lives, their opponent is proclaimed victorious!

I decided upon this project idea because I have had so much fun in the 
past playing simple 2-player games (ex. Fireboy and Watergirl)
